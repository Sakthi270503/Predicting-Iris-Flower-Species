# Iris Flower Species Classification Project

This project implements a machine learning model to classify iris flowers into three species: Setosa, Versicolor, and Virginica. The classification is based on four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

## Overview

The project is implemented in Python using the scikit-learn library for machine learning tasks. It includes the following components:

1. Jupyter Notebook: Contains the code implementation of the machine learning model for iris flower species classification. The notebook walks through the data exploration, preprocessing, model selection, training, evaluation, and deployment steps.

2. Iris Dataset: The dataset used for training and testing the machine learning model. It is a well-known dataset available in scikit-learn and contains 150 samples with measurements of iris flowers.

## Usage

To run the project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

2. Install the required dependencies:

3. Open the Jupyter Notebook:

4. Follow the instructions in the notebook to explore the project, execute the code cells, and train the machine learning model.
